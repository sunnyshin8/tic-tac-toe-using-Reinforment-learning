# Tic Tac Toe Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project implements a Tic Tac Toe game using reinforcement learning techniques. It consists of creating an environment where two players, represented by agents, learn to play Tic Tac Toe against each other. The agents use a simple Q-learning algorithm to make decisions about their moves and improve their strategies over time.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn

## Setup
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Install the required libraries using pip:
   ```
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
